<h3>The Problem</h3><br>
There is a new wave of farmers.  Lots of old time farmers are currently retiring and new ones are entering the workforce.  
This causes a lack of knowledge in the area which allows pest and disease to overtake the farmers crops.  This means we loose crops
which in turn means we loose money.  

<h3>Project Description</h3><br>
We are to bridge the gap between farmers and experts.  We need to develop an Android Mobile Application so farmers can communicate
with experts and resolve issues quickly.  This in turn will save crops and save money.  We should have a ticketing system, 
encyclopedia for pest and disease, and a map to view the current trends.
